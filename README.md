## Version
* 1


## Updates
* You are in your own!
I don't have time to Python, Android Development got me.
I made this repository while I was learning python. Pardon me if you see rusty code :).


## Requirement
* Python 3.5+


## Install
* Not yet, but you can clone/downloaded and use it.
* git clone https://github.com/mzdhr/Movie-Gallery-Python.git


## Usage
* Edit main.py, change **path** string with your movies folder path, in line ~11.
```
path = '/Volumes/Macintosh HD 2/MyBackUpMovies/'
```
* From the terminal write (while you are in the same directory of this repository):
```
python3 main.py
```


## Outputs
* movie_gallery_python.html, located in the same movies folder.


## Examples
![Movie Gallery Python](../master/images/movie_gallery_python01.png "Terminal Weather")
![Movie Gallery Python](../master/images/movie_gallery_python02.png "Terminal Weather")
![Movie Gallery Python](../master/images/movie_gallery_python03.png "Terminal Weather")


## Notes
* The generated html page will be in the same movies folder, that you specified.
* Movies ordered by Date Modified.
* To disable youtube trailers (because it slow the process), set **include_youtube_trailer** in **main.py** to False, by default its:
```
include_youtube_trailer = True
```
* Tried only in Mac OS.
